# Mod1-Project

In this project we analyze the IMDB and Box Office Mojo datasets in order to give management recommendation on the types of movie they can invest in to enter the movie production industry.

First, we answer a high-level question, are high quality movies also profitable? Then we perform a high-level analysis of movie performance (profitability, worldwide gross revenue, production budget) by genre, to uncover the best genres to invest in. We zoom in on two consistently top-performing genres, Horror and Animation, and look at their trends over time. By comparing their average budgets, we recognize they represent two different strategies of entrance.

In the second part of analysis, based on findings from part one of the analysis, we decide to take a deeper dive into two movie genres (Horror and Adventure), and make specific recommendations on the actions the Company should puruse given different objectives.
