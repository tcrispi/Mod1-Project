# Mod1-Project

In this project we analyze the IMDB and Box Office Mojo datasets in order to give management recommendation on the types of movie they can invest in to enter the movie production industry.

## Part I - High Level Analysis

#### Relationship between profitability and movie rating
First, we answer a high-level question, are high quality movies also profitable? 

#### Gross revenue and profitability by genre
Then we perform a high-level analysis of movie performance (profitability, worldwide gross revenue, production budget) by genre, to uncover the best genres to invest in. 

#### Closer look at Profit and Revenue trends of top-performing genres
We zoom in on two consistently top-performing genres, Horror and Animation, and look at their trends over time. By comparing their average budgets, we recognize they represent two different strategies of entrance.


## Part II - Actionable Insights
In the second part of analysis, based on findings from part one of the analysis, we decide to take a deeper dive into two movie genres (Horror and Adventure), and make actionable recommendations that we believe the Company should puruse given different objectives.

Specifically, we have chose to focus on two key areas:

#### Horror Genre Profitability - Writers and Directors
Logic: The popularity/ box office success of Horror movies is rarely tied to the actors/actresses in the film. Which directors and writers consistently produce the most profitable films? 

#### Adventure Genre Revenue Generation - Actors/Actresses and Directors
Logic: Adventure films tend to have high profile actors/actresses and directors.  Which ones consistently participate in films that bring in the most revenue?

## Conclusion

#### Depending on the risk profile of Microsoft, we recommend one of two paths:
1. If the company is looking for more surefire profitability, they should pursue Horror films, and select a writer and a director from our  analyses.

2. If the company is looking for top line box office success, they should pursue Adventure films, and select actors/actresses and a director from our analyses.
